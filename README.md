📝 To-Do List App Description
A minimalist to-do list application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to:
- ✅ Add new tasks using a simple input field
- 🗑️ Delete tasks from the list individually
- 📋 View all tasks neatly organized with <li> elements
The UI is clean and focused, providing an efficient way to manage daily tasks without distractions. Ideal for showcasing DOM manipulation and basic event handling using vanilla JavaScript.

Let me know if you want a version tailored for your GitHub project, or if you'd like to add some stylistic flair using Tailwind CSS!
